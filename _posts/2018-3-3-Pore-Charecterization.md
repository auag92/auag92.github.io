### Description of Pore Characterization work flow

Nanoporous materials are defined as materials having pore
less than 100 nm in size which are often comparable to the size of individual molecules.

Nanoporous materials have a series of unique properties, making nanoporous materials useful for industrially important applications such as gas storage, separations, catalysis, et cetera. A vast number of unique nanoporous materials can be synthesized, varying in chemical composition and pore topology. In addition hundreds of thousand hypothetical materials have been computationally predicted and a considerable number of computational screening studies have appeared in the literature that examine the potential of nanoporous materials for a series of applications.
